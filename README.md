# **Transforming Hostnames to IP Addresses**

hostnames-to-ipaddress.py - script designed to take a domain name or list of domain names as input and output the corresponding IP addresses.

The reason for the script was to learn python but also find a way that could automate the process of finding ip addresseses when given a list
of hostnames and not have to enter them one at a time with ping.  The script provides two options, one for a single domain and one for a file.
