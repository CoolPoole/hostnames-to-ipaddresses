# **Transforming Hostnames to IP Addresses**

The reason for the scripts was to learn python but also find a way that could automate the process of finding ip addresseses when given a list
of hostnames and not have to enter them one at a time with ping.  The script provides two options, one for a single domain and one for a file.

## **Menu Style - hostnames-to-ipaddress.py**

Script designed to take a domain name or list of domain names as input and output the corresponding IP addresses.

## **Usage**

<pre>.\hostnames-to-ipaddress.py</pre>
